1. Data gathering via Fingrid_API which collects Historical hourly consumption and with FMI_API, collecting temperature inm Helsinkli, wiond sped and gust speed

2. Cleaning and Expolarotry data analysis in Data analysis Jupyter notebook

3. Finally, buolding ML modesl such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoos and comparing and visualizing different metric to evaluate their performance
